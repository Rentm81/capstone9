Drugstore in Santiago of Chile

Description of the data

For this work the necessary data were obtained from 2 main sources:


1.	Foursquare.
https://es.foursquare.com/explore?mode=url&near=Santiago%20de%20Chile%2C%20Metropolitana%20de%20Santiago%20de%20Chile%2C%20Chile&nearGeoId=72057594041799272&q=farmacia
2.	Farmanet.

These two sources were used because in Foursquare only data and location are recorded in plans 
of the 3 largest chains (Cruz Verde, Ahumada and Salcobrand), which shows a competitive advantage
 of these compared to the smaller stores in the use of technology that could be a factor to 
consider for future studies.

Due to the above, a database of the State of Chile was used to complement and thus measure the 
contrast between the two types of premises.

The data obtained from these bases, were cleaned leave only 3 columns with the following information:
(Latitude, Longitude, PharmacyName)
(33.450806, -70.677501, GREEN CROSS)

With the above we obtained the records of 197 pharmacies with their respective coordinates which
will be geo-located to look for patterns in their locations.
