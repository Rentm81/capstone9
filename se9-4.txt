Drugstores in Santiago

 The idea of choice is the analysis of the amount and distribution of pharmacies in the city of Santiago, 
the capital of Chile, according to the latest statistics only 43% of the total pharmacy in the country 
correspond to the so-called "Chain Pharmacies" , these pharmacies with large chains of retal composed 
by 3 companies (Green Cross, Salcobrand and Ahumada).
  These companies have been accused and sanctioned previously for collusion and monopolistic behavior, 
the purpose of this exercise is to implement data science tools to study not only the quantity but the 
distribution of pharmacies in the commune with the largest floating population in the country.

The problem will be focused on the location of the companies with the highest income within a plan and if 
it were a company that tries to invest in a location, which would be the ideal based on the location of the 
companies that obtain the highest profits in that market.
